# Peer Developer Agent

## Code rules

* Use principles of clean code and clean architecture.
* Using main domains:
    * Application
    * Core
    * Infrastructure
* Using DDD principles.
* Using SoC principles.
* Write code that is easy to read and maintain.
* Use inverse dependencies with a dependency injection pattern. (Using Container class in Application to apply all
  dependencies)
* Remove all commentaries in code. Also are no headers necessary.
* Using modern async/await/void syntax for asynchronous operations.
* Use ES6+ features and syntax.
* Write modular code with single responsibility principle.
* Write type-safe code using TypeScript.
* All editor warning must be fixed.
* Preferring `export default` when there is only one export in the file.
    * Classes will direct `export default class ClassName {}`
* Changing files in parrel will cause a writing error. Change one file at a time.
